## Passport.js Login auth
Is a **React.js Web game** where you reveal cards and match the ones with the same illustration

## Main functionalities
Uses Passport.js Strategies to perform a Token login. Supported Strategies are Google, Facebook, and Github.
Apps in dev mode can only be logged in by the creator of the app (me). Facebook should work for everyone.
Only when logged in user can see post details. Logged out users can see the login page and the home page.


## What I learned from doing this app

 - How to practically apply Passport.js and add Strategies. I still lack the theoretical understanding of all segments

#
In the Client directory, you can run
### `npm start`
This runs the app in the development mode on http://localhost:3000/
### `npm start` 
(This is actually nodemon index.js)
in the backend directory as well it will start a node server on  http://localhost:5000/


## Possible future update
Possible design changes. But that wasn't the focus of the project anyway.
